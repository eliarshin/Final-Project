In cryptography, a brute-force attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly.
The attacker systematically checks all possible passwords and passphrases until the correct one is found. 
Alternatively, the attacker can attempt to guess the key which is typically created from the password using a key derivation function. 
This is known as an exhaustive key search.

Our Brute Force application will focus on three methodologies : FTP / SSH / HTTP
HTTP:
This function will recieve URL from the user.
The URL is must to be a LOGIN PAGE of the website we want to brute force.
After the user will enter the LOGIN PAGE that he want to brute force, our application
will run by threaded method a lot of login attempt to this website with our passwords list.
Once will be successfull login - the user will recieve the username and the password that made the connection.

FTP:
This function will recieve and FTP address from the user.
The address must be a FTP address otherwise the user will get an error.
After the user will enter the FTP address, our application will start multiple
threads that will try to connect to the service through FTP login.
Once will be successfull login the user will recieve the username and the password that made the connection.

SSH:
This function will recieve SSH address from the user.
The address must be related to SSH machine or service that support SSH.
Once the user gave legit address the application will start threaded SSH connection to the machine.
If will be successfull connection to the machine - the user will recieve the username and the password.
